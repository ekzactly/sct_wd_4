# Lavender Todo App
A simple and elegant todo app built with PHP and session management. This app allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks. Tasks are stored in PHP sessions, making them persist across page reloads, but will be lost once the session expires.

Features:
Add Task: Allows users to add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
Edit Task: Tasks can be edited to update their title, description, and due date.
Complete/Undo Task: Mark tasks as completed with a strikethrough effect, and easily revert the completion status.
Delete Task: Remove tasks from the list with the delete option.
Task Sorting: Tasks are sorted by their due date, with the earliest ones appearing first.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes.
Technologies Used:
PHP: For server-side logic and handling user interactions.
Sessions: To store task data persistently across page reloads.
HTML: For the structure of the app.
CSS: For styling the app and creating a clean, user-friendly interface.
Font Awesome: For icons to improve the user experience.
